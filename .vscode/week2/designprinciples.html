            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <h4>Public Goods</h4>

            <p>The Public Goods website is a good example of Fitt's Law. Fitt's Law teaches us that placing a button in an 
               ideal location and the proper size will make it easier for the user to engage with the wesite. I think that
               the public goods website uses this law well. It's easy to move through the site for shopping and learning more
               about the products they offer. The buttons and images are well placed not only to click, but also to keep you 
               scrolling through.

            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <h4>The Skimm</h4>

            <img src="images/rsz_theskimm.jpg" alt="The Skimm Homepage">
            <p>I really like how The Skimm uses the the principle of repetition. Throughout the site you can see a really good 
               use and repetition of color. They consistently use the same teals, blues, and purples. You can also see repetition
               of shapes. The majority of images are square and utilize the colors used throughout. There is also repetition is 
               the size and fonts of the titles as well as main copy. </p>

            <h3>Symmetry</h3>
            <h4>Clove & Hallow</h4>
            <a href="https://www.cloveandhallow.com/">https://www.cloveandhallow.com/</a>
            <img src="images/rsz_clove.jpg" alt="Clove & Hallow Homepage">
            <p>Clove and Hallow utitlizzes the principle of symmetry. The way things are laid out on the page creates almost a 
               mirror image. In the areas where they use asymmetry there is still a really nice balance. The keep very equal visual
               weight on each side of the page. It creates a nice sense of organization and order and also helps create interest 
               and impact when they do use asymmetry in images and other places on the page.
